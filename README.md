# Arsal Portfolio Page

Minimal landing page for developers.

Developers don't talk much. Their code does all the talking. So here's a minimal landing page for developers.

I wanted a Arsal Portfolio page to showcase everything I do online and I wanted it to be minimal and right to the point rather beautiful and hefty. And I think most of the devs out there would want the same.

## Themes

Arsal Portfolio Page comes in 9 **material themes**.

![9 Material Themes]()

If none of these themes fit within your taste, it's quite easy to customize and create your own too. 


If you already have a GitHub profile (obviously)

* Create a new repo with the name `{username}.github.io`
* Clone/Fork this repo and copy the files to your newly created repo
* Customize your name, links and everything else for your landing page
* `git push`

Voila! Your site should be live at `https://{username}.github.io`

Here's my **Arsal Potfolio Page** - [Arsal Alam - v1](https://arsalalam21.github.io/)

### Custom Domain

If you want to make your new landing page available under a domain like `{username}.com` you can get started here - [Setting up a custom domain](https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/).
